# Paperless

A minimal workspace for writing, thinking and organizing — without the productivity noise.

Paperless combines a clean block-based editor, an AI assistant, and a simple task scheduler into one focused environment.
The goal is not to add more tools, but to remove context-switching while working.

#### You open it → write → think → plan → continue.

Why this exists

Switching between apps breaks focus:
notes → search → AI → tasks → back to notes.

Paperless keeps them in one place so the flow stays uninterrupted.
